# Integration v1.0

 * Enterprise Service Bus
 * SOA + Web Services
 * Enterprise Integration patterns

 > Speaker notes
 The earlier round of Integration did have challenges to solve, but was trying to solve the 
 problems present at the time such as how to connect Databases, Mainframes, ERP systems, File transfer. Not typically direct to the public, focussed on internal & B2B transactions.

 We are trying to achieve a lot of the same objectives the original goals like -- loose coupling, event driven systems but now in a different way than buying a Vendor's product and the options for connecting outside the enterprise have also exploded. (PAAS, SAAS). 

 # Integration v2.0

  * Internet of Things
  * Mobiles, Digital channels
  * Platform as a service
  * Software as a service
  * API's

 * Use 'Contract First' approach - Consumer Driven
 * Contract tests + 'Postel's law'

# We need to talk about..


## Batch

## Direct Integration / Point to Point

# So... What needs to change?

# Integration 1.0 Model

Centralised ICC
